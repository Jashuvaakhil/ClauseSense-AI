# ClauseSense AI

ClauseSense AI is a contract analysis platform that uses multi-agent orchestration to review legal agreements. The system breaks down documents and analyzes them across four domains: Legal, Finance, Compliance, and Operations.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized agents to perform deep-dive analysis on different aspects of a contract.
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Powered by Pinecone and Sentence Transformers for accurate semantic search across large documents.
- **Customizable Reports**: Support for different tones (Formal, Concise, Executive) and structures based on stakeholder needs.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles heavy lifting (embeddings, LLM calls) in background tasks to maintain UI responsiveness.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), LangChain, LangGraph, SentenceTransformers (HuggingFace), Pinecone.
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons.
- **Database**: Pinecone (Vector Store), Local JSON (Action History).
